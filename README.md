## Description
A simple command line NodeJS application to manage employees by role, department and by manager. The data is backed by MySQL. While this project was for homework, it 
gave me a chance to use more complex SQL queries and learn how to better structure a larger Javascript program.

### Features:
- Add departments, roles, and employees
- View departments, roles, and employees
- Change an employee's role or manager
- View employees by manager
- View department budget
